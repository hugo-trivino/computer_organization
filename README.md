# Welcome to my Computer organization project!

This project is written in **VHDL** which stands for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Design. If you are more interested in **Verilog**, make sure to take a look at my VLSI project.

In this project we implemented a Multi-cycle CPU as shown in the image below:
